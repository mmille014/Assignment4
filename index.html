            </article>   
    <p>Reading is my first passion! Just finding the time to unwind by grabbing a cup of coffee, picking up a good book, finding a quiet place to enjoy it and then diving in, nothing beats it! My book list is extremely vast. I have so many books that I had to give many away and start using a Nook and Kindle device. Reading can lower ones blood pressure and  relax the mind and body. My favorite genres include christian fiction, mystery, and suspense. I also enjoy reading the Bible. </p> 

    <p>Watching television is also a favorite pastime of mines. I enjoy all sports (football first), and also like sitcoms and documentaries.</p>

    <p>Listening to music provides a relaxing environment for me. Often times, I will mix this activity with another and find myself really in a comfort zone. This also is helpful when I have trouble falling asleep.</p>

    <p>Anything challenging is peeks my interest. That is why I enjoy mind challenging games. Competing against others makes the games more enjoyable for me. It also provides bragging rights. Some of my favorite games include Pente and scrabble. Othello is also on that list. then There is video games. Video games are in a seperate category all by themselves. They are one of the most competitive and mind challenging things I have involved myself in. They are also very addictive. </p>
        
    <p>Finally, my last passion is helping others in anyway I can. Sometimes its with financial advising, counseling, or even assisting customers who still have my number and are having a problem with their Comcast services or personal equipment such as their computers. It is my belief that my gift is the gift of help. </p>

    <p>So there you have it. A little information about me and my hobbies. Take some time to try your hand at some of these. You just might find a new hobby.</p>
