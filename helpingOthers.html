            <img src="https://www.bing.com/images/blob?bcid=Tr0Kb.R66y4BBg" alt="">
            <p>Finally, my last passion is helping others in anyway I can. Sometimes its with financial advising, counseling, or even assisting customers who still have my number and are having a problem with their Comcast services or personal equipment such as their computers. It is my belief that my gift is the gift of help. </p>
            <p>So there you have it. A little information about me and my hobbies. Take some time to try your hand at some of these. You just might find a new hobby.</p>
