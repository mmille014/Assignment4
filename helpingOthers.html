            <p>Finally, my last passion is helping others in anyway I can. Sometimes its with financial advising, counseling, or even assisting customers who still have my number and are having a problem with their Comcast services or personal equipment such as their computers. It is my belief that my gift is the gift of help. </p>
            <p>So there you have it.</p>
            <p>A little information about me and my hobbies.</P>
            <p>Take some time to try your hand at some of these.</p>
            <p>You just might find a new hobby.</p>
